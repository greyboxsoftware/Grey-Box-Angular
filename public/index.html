	<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello my name is Kevin Johnson the owner of Grey Box Software Solutions and I want to welcome you to my PowerShell
	quick reference page. To be completly honest, I didnt make this page to display detailed information on PowerShell syntax
	instead this is mostly to showcase AngularJS in my portfolio. If you are interested in learning about PowerShell I highly
	encourage you to visit my <a class="aColor" href="http://www.greyboxsoftwaresolutions.com">website</a>.</h2>
	<h2 class="text-center">This demo site is built using AngularJS</h2>
	<p class="width100 text-center formPadding">What is your name?</p> 
	<input class="width100 text-center" ng-model="first"><br>
	<p class="width100 text-center formPadding" ng-hide="!first.length">Click below to acknowledge that the syntax in this list is not a complete list. </p>
	<p class="width100 text-center formPadding" ng-hide="!first.length" >I acknowledge <input type="checkbox" ng-model="hideForm" ng-click="showHeader=true;" ></p>
	</form>
	</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row" ng-show="showHeader">
	<div class="col-md-12"></div>
	<h2 class="text-center">Welcome to Basic Syntax for PowerShell {{first}}</h2>
	
	<button class="text-center width100 buttonPadding button" ng-click="comments()"><h2>Comments</h2></button>
	<p class="betweenButtonPadding"></p>
	
	<p ng-show="showComments">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments are essential in programming not only for you if you are creating a long script and don't want 
	to forget what you did or if you are transferring the script to someone else. Comments are great and a absolute essential. 
	Comments are simple and they are lines followed by <br><br>
	#
	<br><br>
	#I am a comment<br>
	#This is another comment </p>
	
	<button class="text-center width100 buttonPadding button" ng-click="variables()"><h2>Variables</h2></button>
	<p class="betweenButtonPadding"></p>
	
	<p ng-show="showVariables">
	
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Software would be almost useless without variables. If you are a programmer then you will use variables in everyday life. In
	PowerShell variables are really really easy and when I say that it means that PowerShell doesnt require you to specify type
	of variable i.e. Int, String, Double, etc...<br><br>
	All variables in PowerShell start with the "$" character. 
	<br><br>
	$variableHere = "I am a variable and a string"
	<br>
	$variableNumber = 4
	<br><br>
	Variable do not have to be declared as a specific type in PowerShell. </p>
	
	
	<button class="text-center width100 buttonPadding button" ng-click="connections()"><h2>Test-Connection</h2></button>
	<p class="betweenButtonPadding"></p>
	
	<p ng-show="showConnections">
	
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every beloved DOS command there is a PowerShell command that does it better and in this case the ping command
		is replaced by Test-Connection. This is very simple and you can do alot but a basic example is as follows. 
		<br><br>
		Test-Connection -ComputerName www.google.com -Count 1
		
	
	</p>
	
	
	<button class="text-center width100 button buttonPadding" ng-click="wmiobject()"><h2>Get-WmiObject</h2></button>
		<p class="betweenButtonPadding"></p>
		<p ng-show="showwmiobjects">
	
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WMI .... if you ever been a system or network admin then I am sure you have colorful words to say about WMI in Windows systems.
		If you like I will wait while you cuss a little bit ............. okay we are back, feel better? PowerShell tries to 
		make WMI a little bit easier. In this example we will list installed programs on a remote machine
		<br><br>
		Get-WmiObject -ComputerName COMP-Example -Class Win32_Product. 
		<br><br>
		Now sit back and wait and prepare for your console window to blow up ... metaphorically of course. :)

	<p class="betweenButtonPadding"></p>

	<p ng-show="showLearnMore">
	
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would like to learn more about PowerShell scripting then there is a website that breaks down everything
		there is to know about PowerShell and that is the <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/">
		Hey, Scripting Guy! Blog"</a>. This blog is a great place to start if you are just now beginning. 
		<br><br>
		However I would be remissed if I did not mention my <a href="http://www.greyboxsoftwaresolutions.com/category/tips-tricks-how-to/powershell-scripting/"
		>PowerShell Blog</a>. My blog differs from the aforementioned blog due to the fact I post problems that I have had and tell you 
		how I remediated them.
