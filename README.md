# Grey-Box-Angular
Hello my name is Kevin Johnson and I am a freelance softwware developer and owner of Grey Box Software Solutions. 

This GIT repository is dedicated to showcasing some AngularJS talents for my portfolio. This single page web app gives some PowerShell terms that is mostly just a filler so if you are looking for a detailed showcase of PowerShell skills then I encourage you to visit my website www.greyboxsoftwaresolutions.com

Some of the AngularJS in this GIT is geared towards the following: 
  - Showing how angularJS can hide and show html elements depending on conditions with ease 
  - Showing how you can have alot of information on a single page. 

Thank you if you have suggestions or comments the please feel free to let me know, I am always open to progress and doing things better. Thank You.
